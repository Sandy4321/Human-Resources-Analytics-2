# Human Resources Analytics
This is my try of using Kaggle dataset of Human Resources Analytics. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics or you can use the files(HR_comma_sep.csv) I have used Support Vector Machine & Decision Tree Classifier for it.

The dependencies I used are

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn

I would love to see if any of u can make it more better.
